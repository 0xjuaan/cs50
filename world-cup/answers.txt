Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

With a small number of simulations (10), the randomness of the simulations had a much greater effect on the result.
This is evident since when using this number of simulations, portugal and argentina were given a 20% chance of winning each.
These high predictions for portugal and argentina gradually decrease as the number of simulations increases. This shows that
these findings are inaccurate.


Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilised after about 50,000 simulations, and further increasing the number of
simulations would provide only a marginal increase in accuracy of the predictions.
Hence after 50000, I would say this is enough simulations.

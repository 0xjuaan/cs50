sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: When increasing 'n', going from random5k to random10k, the running time
increased much more with sort1 than sort2. Thus sort2 is faster --> Sort1 is bubble sort.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Quickest. As N increases, running time does not increase too significantly.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: With the sorted.txt files, I compared sorted 5,000 and sorted 50,000.
Since the files were already sorted, the increase in time taken for sort1 and sort2 was not that much
but sort3 increased by over 20x. This must be a linear search algorithm since it does not terminate until every value is checked.
SO increasing 'n' increases the time taken for 50k to sort.

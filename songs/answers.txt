Question 1: If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Answer: THeir audio aura is quite highly danceable, and also decently energetic, with an average level of valency/cheerfulness.


Question 2: Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
Answer: I calculated the aura through simply averaging the above metrics across the 100 songs. This means that if the listener is someone who enjoys music on both ends of the spectrum of these
numerical metrics, the average would convey that they do not lean towards a specific type of music.
